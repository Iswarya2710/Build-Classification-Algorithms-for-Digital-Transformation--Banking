# Build-Classification-Algorithms-for-Digital-Transformation--Banking

# Overview
This project is a comprehensive guide to building classification algorithms for digital transformation in the banking industry. Classification algorithms are a fundamental component of data-driven decision-making in banking, helping automate processes, reduce risk, and improve customer experiences.

Digital transformation is reshaping the banking industry, making data-driven decision-making more critical than ever. Classification algorithms help banks automate tasks such as fraud detection, credit scoring, customer segmentation, and more. This project aims to provide a roadmap for implementing classification algorithms in banking.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (for running example notebooks)
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, Flask (for deployment), and any other relevant libraries.
